/**
 * Runtime identity — prove which package's `gsd-tools` actually executed (#3146).
 *
 * The predecessor package `get-shit-done-cc` publishes a colliding `gsd-tools`
 * bin (verified 2026-08-24 against 1.42.3: `bin.gsd-tools -> bin/gsd-sdk.js`),
 * and exposes verbs of the same name with different semantics. #3129 is the
 * worked example: `phases.clear` archives here and **deletes** there, and the
 * output is success-shaped either way, so 43 phase directories went missing
 * with no warning.
 *
 * That collision is now prevented in the resolver rather than detected here:
 * the launcher's PATH branch resolves `gsd_run`, which only this package
 * publishes and which self-locates to its sibling shim, so a foreign binary is
 * unreachable from PATH. The path-based branches — a project-local install, a
 * runtime config directory — have no such structural guarantee: they trust
 * their configured location. #3841 closes that remaining route by making the
 * launcher preamble PROBE the resolved tool once, before any verb runs, and
 * warn when it cannot prove it is this package. This module backs both the
 * `runtime-identity` verb the preamble calls and the vocabulary that gate
 * reports in (`IDENTITY_STATUS`).
 *
 * The rollout is warn-then-fail (the #3146 maintainer ruling): the preamble
 * prints one actionable line and proceeds. It cannot hard-fail yet because
 * `no_identity_verb` does not distinguish a foreign package from an
 * `@opengsd/gsd-core` older than the verb — and during rollout the old-version
 * case is the common one, so a hard failure would stop working installs.
 *
 * Parsing is deliberately STRICT. The whole value of the check is telling "us"
 * from "not us"; a lenient parse that accepts the predecessor's usage text as
 * close-enough would reproduce the exact silent success #3129 already produced.
 * Liberality is spent on visibility instead — distinct reason codes, each
 * naming what actually happened.
