# Personal Fork Instructions & AI Agent Rules

> **Repository Context**: Personal fork (`denniyahh/gsd-core`) of OpenGSD (`open-gsd/gsd-core`).

## 1. Branching & PR Rules
* **Integration Target**: Almost all Pull Requests target **`upstream/next`** (not `main`).
* **Branch Creation**: Always branch off `upstream/next` (`git checkout next && git pull upstream next`).
* **Pull Requests**: Open PRs targeting `upstream/next` using `gh pr create --base next --repo open-gsd/gsd-core`.

## 2. Environment & Tooling
* **Tool Manager**: Use `mise` for Node 22 and task management.
* **Remote CI Runner**: Pre-flight verification routes automatically to the local Mac runner via `mise run check` / `scratch/ci-mac.sh`.
* **Branch & Worktree Setup Helper**: Use `mise run start:wt <type> <issue-number> <slug>` (e.g. `mise run start:wt fix 2783 wedged-pr-note`) to create task worktrees off `upstream/next` populated with personal workflow capabilities.
* **Pre-flight & Pre-push Commands (STRICT ENFORCEMENT)**:
  * Check environment: `mise run check` (or `npm run check:env`)
  * Full build: `npm run build` (or `npm run build:lib`)
  * Run CI linter: `npm run lint:ci`
  * Run unit tests: `npm test`
  * **Rule**: You MUST run `npm run build && npm run lint:ci && npm test` (or `mise run check`) before pushing to `origin`.

## 3. Worktree-Safe Contribution Flow
* **Sync, then isolate**: Run `mise run sync` in this primary checkout. For AI-assisted work, create the task branch in a separate worktree via `mise run start:wt <type> <issue-number> <slug>`.
* **Validation**: Run `mise run check` from the task worktree (which automatically syncs and verifies on the Mac runner) before requesting review or opening a PR. Use narrower suites (e.g. `mise run test:mac`) during the edit loop when appropriate.
* **Publishing**: Push task branches to `origin`; open the upstream PR only after the approved issue, required test evidence, changeset (when applicable), and PR template are ready.
* **Personal-fork files**: `.agents/`, `mise.toml`, and `scratch/` are personal workflow material. They may be committed to `denniyahh/gsd-core`, but must be excluded from PRs to `open-gsd/gsd-core` unless their content is explicitly in scope.
* **Local state**: Never stage `.local/`; it is intentionally locally ignored and can contain machine-specific GitHub state.

## 4. Reference Notes
* See [scratch/FORK_NOTES.md](file:///home/denniyahh/Github/gsd-core/scratch/FORK_NOTES.md) for local environment notes and shortcuts.
* Keep the shared DevFlow dogfooding ledger at [scratch/UPSTREAM-GSD-ISSUES.md](file:///home/denniyahh/Github/gsd-core/scratch/UPSTREAM-GSD-ISSUES.md). DevFlow links to this file; record only upstream GSD issues there.

## 5. PR & Contribution Formatting (CRITICAL)
* **PR Title Format**: Must strictly follow `type(#<issue>): short summary` (e.g. `fix(#3158): branch protection checks`). Do not use brackets like `[fix]`.
* **Changesets Required**: Every PR with user-facing changes MUST have a `.changeset/*.md` fragment created via `npm run changeset`. The fragment MUST include `pr: <NNN>` in its frontmatter.
* **PR Templates**: You must use the correct GitHub template for the PR type (e.g. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/fix.md`). Do NOT use the default template or overwrite it with a blank body.
* **Documentation**: If your changeset type is `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, or `Removed`, you must update the relevant file in `docs/` OR add the `<!-- docs-exempt: <reason> -->` marker in the changeset fragment.
* **CI Verification Rules**:
  * ALWAYS query status via `gh run list --workflow Tests` or `gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>`. Never rely on un-filtered `gh run list` (which returns single-job sidecars).
  * NEVER post a comment to maintainers stating that a PR is ready for review until ALL GitHub Actions CI checks have completed successfully (100% green).
